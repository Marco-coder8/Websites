    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Plain all purpose flour compared to cake flour, the flavour of the butter and vanilla comes through better, the crumb is slightly more velvety AND it keeps slightly more moist too. Bonus: no need to hunt down / pay a premium for cake flour! Do not substitute with self raising flour or gluten free flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong> whipped to aerate, these are key to make the cake extraordinarily light and fluffy. You don’t get an eggy flavour.</li>
        <li><strong> Baking powder</strong>  not baking soda (bi-carb), it doesn’t rise as well. This is our safety net, extra helping hand to make the cake rise</li>
        <li><strong>Milk, full fat </strong>just plain cow milk. Low fat works as well but rises marginally less. Do not substitute with non dairy milk or buttermilk.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>  best to use caster / superfine sugar if you can because it dissolves better in the eggs. But regular / granulated sugar works just fine too  you may just end up with some little brown spots on the base.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>  just 1 tablespoon adds a noticeable hint of extra moistness, especially on Day 4, without weighing down the cake in the slightest. Don’t be tempted to add more  I tried an extra tablespoon and it didn’t rise as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla extract</strong>   the best you can afford. Imitation will work just fine, but the flavour isn’t as pure or real. I use Queen Vanilla Extract. Don’t waste your money on vanilla beans or vanilla bean paste  it’s not worth it for cakes</li>
